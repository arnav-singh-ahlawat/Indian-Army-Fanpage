    <c>In the Indian Army, "services" generally refer to the various branches or arms of the military, each specializing in different functions or roles. These services include:</c><br>
    <h1>1. Combat Uniform (Battle Dress)</h1>
    <ol>
      The combat uniform is designed for field operations and combat situations. It typically consists of camouflage-patterned trousers and shirt made of durable and breathable fabric. Soldiers may also wear a tactical vest or load-bearing equipment for carrying gear and ammunition. Headgear often includes a camouflage-patterned helmet or a beret.
    </ol>

    <h1>2. Service Dress</h1>
    <ol>
      The service dress is worn during formal occasions, ceremonial events, and non-combat duties. It typically includes a khaki-colored shirt and trousers for officers and a darker shade for other ranks. Officers may wear peaked caps or berets with their service dress, while other ranks wear berets or side caps. Ribbons, medals, and insignia denoting rank and unit are worn on the uniform.
    </ol>

    <h1>3. Mess Dress</h1>
    <ol>
      The mess dress is worn during formal dinners, social events, and other formal occasions. It is more elaborate than the service dress and often includes a black or dark-colored jacket with trousers. Officers may wear cummerbunds or waistcoats, and other ranks may wear waistcoats. Headgear typically includes peaked caps or bowler hats, depending on the regiment or corps.
    </ol>

    <h1>4. Ceremonial Uniform</h1>
    <ol>
      The ceremonial uniform is worn during parades, state occasions, and other ceremonial events. It is highly decorative and often includes elaborate headgear, such as turbans or ceremonial caps adorned with plumes. The uniform may feature intricate embroidery, gold braid, and other embellishments. Soldiers may carry ceremonial weapons or other regalia as part of the uniform.
    </ol>

    <h1>5. Physical Training (PT) Uniform</h1>
    <ol>
      The PT uniform is worn during physical training sessions and exercises. It typically consists of a T-shirt and shorts or tracksuit bottoms in a specific color designated by the unit or branch. Soldiers may also wear sweatshirts or jackets in cooler weather, along with sports shoes or boots.
